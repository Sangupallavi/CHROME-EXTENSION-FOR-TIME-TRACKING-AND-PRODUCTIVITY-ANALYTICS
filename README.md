##DESCRIPTION## 

The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension is a powerful tool designed to monitor and enhance user productivity while browsing the web. Developed using a full stack approach, this project integrates frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a robust backend built on Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The extension helps users keep track of time spent on various websites, categorize them as productive or unproductive, and generate insightful summaries to reflect usage patterns.

The core functionality begins with the Chrome extension interface, which tracks the currently active tab and records the duration a user spends on each site. This data is captured using the Chrome Extension APIs and sent to the backend server. Users can log in or sign up through a clean and user-friendly interface, with authentication handled by Express.js sessions or tokens. Once logged in, the extension begins recording time logs in real-time.

On the backend, the Express server handles incoming data, manages user sessions, and interacts with the MongoDB database. Each user has a personal record that includes visited URLs, timestamps, and time spent. MongoDB efficiently stores and retrieves this data for further analysis and reporting.

To provide valuable feedback, the extension offers a dashboard (accessible via the extension popup or a separate page) that visualizes time spent across websites. The interface is designed with CSS and JavaScript to make it clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. Users can view pie charts or bar graphs showing how their time was distributed among productive and non-productive sites throughout the day or week.

What sets this project apart is its focus on self-awareness and improvement. Users can tag websites as “productive” or “unproductive,” allowing the system to categorize and analyze their behavior over time. This empowers users to make informed decisions about their digital habits, improving focus and efficiency.

Overall, this productivity tracker is a great example of a real-world full stack project. It combines browser extension development with modern web technologies and a backend that supports real-time data logging and analysis. It serves as a practical and impactful tool for individuals aiming to take control of their digital time and boost their productivity. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in web development but also solves a meaningful problem faced by many in the digital age.
